Nearly 90 percent of the insiders in the Republican Party made this prediction, which is the hope and aspiration of many Republicans who are embarrassed both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have garnered so much support from Republican voters.Cruz and Trump s insane rhetoric and policy proposals almost make Ohio Governor John Kasich look like a Democrat in comparison. As Republicans cannot come to a consensus over a presidential nominee, the Republican Party will likely fall apart at the convention. If Donald Trump doesn t win the nomination after winning the most pledged delegates, he would likely make a third party run as his ego will not accept losing as an option. His supporters will likely engage in violent protesting as the patients take over the insane asylum. Trump supporters have treated anyone who dares defy the Donald at rallies with violence, there is no telling what they will do if the Republican Party doesn t hand over the keys to the presidential nomination. Donald Trump has one chance to win the nomination, and that is on the first ballot. Right now, I put his chances at about 40 percent, and that will require him to get some number of delegates from the unpledged delegates in states like North Dakota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and a few territories,  an Iowa Republican said in his response to the Politico survey, which was conducted anonymously. Even if Donald Trump does win the Republican nomination at the convention, so many Republicans despise him and his rise in the party, they would rather have a Democrat in the White House than listen to Donald Trump steer the direction of the GOP, which right now is going full speed off a cliff.Featured image courtesy of Flickr\",\n          \"Justice Department seeks warrant to seize ancient ring trafficked by ISIS WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it is seeking a warrant so it can seize an ancient ring believed to be trafficked by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the militant organization also known as \\u201cISIS.\\u201d The department also said it was amending a year-old forfeiture complaint it had filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to add three more antiquities. The ancient ring being sought by the U.S. government is believed to be in the hands of Turkish law enforcement, after it was confiscated from a Syrian antiquities trafficker.\",\n          \"Trump calls for waterboarding, other methods in U.S. fight against Islamic State WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican White House front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday he would be open to harsh measures to deal with the threat from Islamic State, including going beyond the controversial interrogation tactic known as waterboarding. In an interview on ABC\\u2019s \\u201cThis Week\\u201d program, Trump discussed reviving the tactic and implementing other interrogation techniques, pointing to the recent beheadings of Christians in the Middle East as evidence of the need for stronger interrogation methods for suspected operatives of extremist groups. \\u201cWe\\u2019re like living in medieval times,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf I have to do it and if it\\u2019s up to me, I would absolutely bring back waterboardng. And if it\\u2019s going to be tougher than waterboarding, I would bring that back, too.\\u201d When pressed by interviewer George Stephanopoulos if that meant the United States employing similar methods of beheading captors, Trump responded: \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to do things beyond waterboarding,\\u201d adding, \\u201cPerhaps, if that happens to come.\\u201d The issue of waterboarding and other methods of interrogation was raised during Saturday night\\u2019s New Hampshire Republican debate aired on ABC, with the billionaire businessman saying he would not only revive the controversial method\\u2019s use, but bring back \\u201ca hell of a lot worse\\u201d  if elected. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someone\\u2019s face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture, and Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009. Trump\\u2019s rival and a fellow leader in opinion polls, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said during the debate that he would only allow limited use of the practice but said it did not constitute torture.    Waterboarding was used by the CIA under the Bush administration during the early days of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Its defenders say it helped to keep America safe by garnering more information from captives, but critics argued the method never actually yielded actionable intelligence. Republicans have been critical of Obama\\u2019s decision to eliminate the practice, saying it telegraphs a position of weakness to the nation\\u2019s enemies and concedes that the United States erred in using waterboarding. On Sunday, Trump argued that the \\u201cevil\\u201d nature of modern times required more robust interrogation techniques, saying that U.S. enemies are thriving in the absence of them. \\u201cThey laugh at us.  Our enemies laugh at us, George.  They say waterboarding, they don\\u2019t even think it\\u2019s a form - you know, they don\\u2019t even view that as real torture,\\u201d he said. New Hampshire, where Trump maintains a lead over Republican rivals in the U.S. nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election, casts its primary ballots on Tuesday, the week after Iowa kicked off the process.

But spokesman Josh Earnest said there was \\u201cno offense taken\\u201d by the decision which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday ascribed to a desire to steer clear of the U.S. presidential election campaign. It was the latest episode in a fraught relationship between the right-wing Israeli leader and the Democratic U.S. president that has yet to recover from deep differences over last year\\u2019s U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Israel\\u2019s foe Iran. In a stark reminder of the paralysis in peace talks which Obama tried to revive earlier in his tenure, an American tourist was stabbed to death on a boardwalk in Tel Aviv in the most serious of several Palestinian attacks on Tuesday. The stabbing occurred about the time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden began a two-day visit to Israel. Biden met former Israeli president Shimon Peres and was due to hold talks on Wednesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank. With a wave of Palestinian street attacks now five months old, U.S. officials did not expect a peace breakthrough during Biden\\u2019s visit. A 2010 Biden visit was marred by acrimony over a Jewish settlement plan Israel announced during his trip.  The White House said on Monday it had been \\u201csurprised\\u201d to learn first from Israeli media that Netanyahu had decided against coming to a conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC in Washington on March 20, and to see a suggestion in some reports that Obama\\u2019s unavailability had been one of the reasons. It said Netanyahu had been offered a March 18 meeting with Obama, ahead of the president\\u2019s landmark visit to Cuba on March 21 and 22. Asked whether the Netanyahu government should have told the Obama administration before the media, Earnest said on Tuesday, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s just good manners.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0  Zeev Elkin, an Israeli cabinet minister close to Netanyahu, countered that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer had given the White House advance warning the trip might not happen. Netanyahu\\u2019s office cited the U.S. election campaign in saying he would not travel to Washington for the AIPAC event, and voiced appreciation for Obama\\u2019s willingness to host him. In 2012, Netanyahu hosted Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney in Israel in what many Democrats saw as a bid to undermine Obama\\u2019s attempt to secure a second term. Israel denied meddling. While candidates for the Republican and Democratic presidential nomination have been vying to assert their credentials as friends of Israel, Obama is not up for re-election in November, having served a maximum two terms.  Earnest said Biden was not in Israel to handle talks over a memorandum of understanding about the United States providing military support to Israel. There was a separate channel through which those negotiations were taking place, he said.\",\n          \"Field commander in U.S.-backed SDF expects Raqqa fight to end Monday BEIRUT (Reuters) - A field commander for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Raqqa said the alliance was carrying out clearing operations against Islamic State and expected to control the city by the end of Monday.  Ilham Ahmed, a senior Kurdish leader who co-chairs the SDF s political wing, said she expected the end of the Raqqa offensive to be announced  within hours or days , but a U.S.-led coalition spokesman said he could not put a timeline on it.

Here\\u2019s PROOF Democrats Have NOTHING On Jeff Sessions [VIDEO] Watch: Fox News' Catherine Herridge has the latest on AG Jeff Sessions and Russia. https://t.co/9s4PWKABvR pic.twitter.com/i0Djb4vSzB  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 2, 2017Several senators on both sides of the aisle rushed to back Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday as he sought to blunt resignation calls from senior Democrats, following revelations he met last year with Russia s ambassador   a detail omitted from recent congressional testimony.His defenders say such meetings between senators and diplomats were routine. And Sessions even got an inadvertent boost from Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who in demanding the AG s resignation initially claimed she never called or met with Russia s ambassador   only for tweets to surface indicating she had, at least twice.Other former colleagues intentionally came to Sessions  defense, backing the former Alabama senator s claim he only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I ve met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators,  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told CNN.  That s in my official capacity. That s nothing. That s my job. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in a statement that he d talked to  at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks. It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election,  Blunt said.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on MSNBC that he d met with  six ambassadors in the last five months.  Though he hadn t met with Kislyak, Cruz said he would do so without reservations.The statements of support came as other lawmakers   including the two top-ranking Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schemer   demanded Sessions  resignation.
